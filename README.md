## Available Skills

### Crafter Plugin

The `crafter` plugin provides skills for day-to-day software development:

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **tdd** | `/tdd` | Boundary-focused TDD workflow enforcing L3/L4 altitude testing and property-based tests |
| **research** | `/research` | Spawns parallel subagents to explore a codebase and produce a compact research artifact |
| **draft** | `/draft` | Consumes research artifact and produces a compact implementation plan with L3/L4 test specs |
| **craft** | `/craft` | Executes an implementation plan phase by phase with strict test-first discipline |
| **refactor** | `/refactor` | Refactoring process with test safety and incremental commits |
| **pair** | `/pair` | Guided pair-programming mode where Claude teaches rather than writes code |

#### RPI Methodology (Research → Draft → Craft)

The crafter plugin's core workflow for non-trivial features:

1. **Research** (`/research`) — Explore the codebase with parallel subagents, output a compact research artifact
2. **Draft** (`/draft`) — Consume the research artifact, produce a compact implementation plan with test specs
3. **Craft** (`/craft`) — Execute the plan phase by phase with strict RED → GREEN → REFACTOR discipline

### Scaffolder Plugin

The `scaffolder` plugin provides skills for software architecture:

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **hexagonal-architecture** | `/hexagonal-architecture` | Applies hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture with domain-first design |
